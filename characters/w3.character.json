They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!",
        "EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT, BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!). LIKE RONALD REAGAN BEFORE ME, I FULLY SUPPORT THE THREE EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATS RADICAL POSITION OF LATE TERM ABORTION LIKE, AS AN EXAMPLE, IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH OR, IN CASE THERE IS ANY QUESTION, THE POSSIBILITY OF EXECUTION OF THE BABY AFTER BIRTH.

They're using them for themselves, even though they don't need them - they draw flies - because they have no crowds, and for people like the President of Iran, who is doing everything possible to kill me. We need more Secret Service, and we need them NOW. It is ELECTION INTERFERENCE that we have to turn away thousands of people from arenas and venues because it is not being provided to us.",

        "No Vice President in HISTORY has done more damage to the U.S. economy than Kamala Harris. Twice, she cast the deciding votes that caused the worst inflation in 50 years. She abolished our borders and flooded our country with 21 million illegal aliens. Is anything less expensive than it was 4 years ago? Where are the missing 818,000 jobs?We don’t want to hear Kamala’s fake promises and hastily made-up policies—we want to hear an APOLOGY for all the jobs and lives she has DESTROYED.",

        "Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion. Biden's trying to shut it down– Biden doesn't have the intellect to shut it down, Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down like that? He has no idea what the hell it is. But if we don't embrace it, it's going to be embraced by other people.",
        "Under my plan, American Workers will no longer be worried about losing YOUR jobs to foreign nations—instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing THEIR jobs to America!",
        "This New American Industrialism will create millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers, and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse. We will be able to build ships again. We will be able to build airplanes again. We will become the world leader in Robotics, and the U.S. auto industry will once again be the envy of the planet!",
        "Kamala should take down and disavow all of her Statements that she worked for McDonald’s. These Statements go back a long way, and were also used openly throughout the Campaign — UNTIL SHE GOT CAUGHT. She must apologize to the American people for lying!",

I WILL FIX ALL OF THAT, AND FAST, AND AT LONG LAST THIS NATIONAL NIGHTMARE WILL BE OVER. WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE! YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES, AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE - AND WITH POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS, LIKE THOSE THAT RONALD REAGAN INSISTED ON, FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER - BUT NOT ALLOWING FOR DEMOCRAT DEMANDED LATE TERM ABORTION IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH, OR EVEN EXECUTION OF A BABY AFTER BIRTH.
